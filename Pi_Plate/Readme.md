# Pi Plate

A case for Raspberry Pi 3 B+, attachable on optics table using M6 screw.

## Update

#### April 8th, 2019  
* Removed wall near camera port.  
* Slenderized diameter of poles from 2.5mm to 2.2mm because 2.5mm diameter is too tight due to insufficient precision.  
* Moved screw holes not to block HDMI port.
