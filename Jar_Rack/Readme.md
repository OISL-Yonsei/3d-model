# Jar Rack

Rack for hanging jars from Carolina Biological (volvox, euglena, chlamydomonas, etc.)  

## Components
* **Base**: Foundation of the rack.  
Being wide to maintain stability against external forces, i.e. shaking of a table, a mistaken hit by an experimenter's finger.  
Has 2 pairs of square holes to embed X-Pillars.  
Has a pair of 90-degree-bent-shaped concave and convex assembler for connecting multiple bases.  
**Caution**: Make sure that the flat surface meets the floor. This will not make any supports, saving your filament and time.
* **X-Pillar**: Column which supports jars and their holders.  
X-shape is selected instead of straight-line shape to include triangular structure for stability.  
Arrow-shaped wedges on the tip of each end keep pillar and its connected ones, i.e. base or ramped holders, from unwanted separation.
* **Ramped Holder**: Rectangularly concave part that holds a thin, circular bulge of a jar.  
Its edges of open side is ramped upward to prevent jars from slipping when a slight tilt is applied.  
Has 4 pairs of square holes to embed X-Pillars; 2 for downward, 2 for upward.

## Updates

### Base

#### April 10th, 2016
* Base assembler gaps (each side) are increased from 0.25mm to 0.4mm because bilateral 0.25mm gap was too tight with 0.1mm resolution.

#### April 8th, 2019
* Base assembler gaps (each side) are reduced from 0.5mm to 0.25mm because bilateral 0.5mm gap was sloppy with 0.1mm resolution.
